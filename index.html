				<h3>Me as a daughter of both OFW parents.</h3>
				<p>
					Being a child of an OFW is not easy. My parents are always gone. Sometimes, my dad or my mom will go home once a year, but it was never enough. They missed a lot of my birthdays or my sibling’s birthdays which is really sad. As I remember, I only experience one Christmas and New Year’s Day with my mom. It was a very difficult time for me because I feel so alone. It is great to receive a lot of gifts from my parents but sometimes I wish I will see them every time I go home from school. I rather exchange the gifts that I received to be able to be with my parents. I always envy kids who have their parents with them at all times. I feel sad whenever I see a whole happy family together and it is terrible because I start to feel that I rather live a simple life than wealthy life. One time, I asked my mom “Why do you work abroad?” and she said that “I work abroad because this is for your future and your sibling’s future. ”
				</p>
				<p>
	 I think that it is important to highlight the sacrifices of OFWs because they work so hard to provide a better future to their love-ones.

						Some women choose to follow men, and some choose to follow their dreams. If you’re wondering which way to go, remember that your career will never wake up and tell you that it doesn’t love you anymore.
